    <h1>My aim in life</h1>
    
    <p style=color:blue<> Becoming a freelancer is an increasingly popular career move and often an attractive alternative to be an
         employee. Try to improve my skill. Work hard in every month for career development. Adding new skills will also open up a wider 
         choice of jobs, which could pay better and potentially lead you into new and interesting job. Speak to clients and other 
         freelancers about the kind of skills they think are important for the future of work in my sector. I want to become full stack
          devolper.
